registers on the forth machine
- pstack : parameter stack (where parameters will be stored until operation requires them)
- rstack : return stack (holds the instruction of the operation (i.e. forth word) to execute)
- dict : dictionary of words
- compiling : 
- dtable :

defines the words in the dictionary
dictionary = linked list of words that we would use to see if a word is defined.
name - name of symbol
prev - previous pointer to previous word in dictionary
immediate - whether or not word is evaluated at compile-time or run-time like a lisp macro
thread - used in metaprogramming as well. This helps in determining how to structure code
specifically, on what level of indirection should a word be compiled to one of the following
strategies:
  - calling a subroutine (subroutine-threaded code)
  - calling an adjacent memory cell pointing to an instruction (so called indirect/direct threaded code)
  - accessing a fixnum that representing a pointer to the word in the same compilation thread (token threading)
  - Take advantage of Lisp's dynamic typing and cons cell list structure to access the next execution 
    form (called cons-threaded code in the book).
